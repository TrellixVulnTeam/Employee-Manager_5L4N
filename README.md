# Employee-Manager
A web app that can keep track of employees via CRUD operations.

To run the app, create a MySQL database named "employeemanager". Then, put in your root user and password in the application.properties file in the backend folder. Once the local database is created, you should be good to run both the front and back end locally. To see the app, visit the port that the front end was created on in your local browser.
