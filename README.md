# Employee-Manager
A web app that can keep track of employees via CRUD operations

To run the app, create a MySQL database named "employeemanager". Then, put in your root user and password in the application.properties file in the backend folder. Once the local database is created, you should be good to run both the front and back end. To see the app, visit the port that it was opened on your machine.
